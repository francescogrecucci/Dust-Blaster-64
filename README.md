# Dust-Blaster-64
Dust-Blaster-64 is a cleaning software for Microsoft Windows made up by various tools. Each tool is a different Class Library (.dll) integrated into the main Application. I hope that with open source we can make a big cleaning software with a lot of useful tools made by developers all around the world.
